// This tool was written in a very large corporation world with extreme edge use-cases in mind. Therefore it's very flexible and it has
// large amount of options that may look quite hard to understand on first sight. While it supports generic LDAP protocol it was written
// with Active Directory in mind. This tool supports multiple authentication schemes such as:
// * anyone who has access to LDAP / AD can use it without limits (keep g_auth_roles and g_auth_allowed_users NULL)
// * selected users can login only (g_auth_allowed_users)
// * RBAC access - there are roles defined with fine-grained permissions where each user is bound to one or more of these roles (groups)
// Many of the options present in this config may be left as default value unless you are aiming for one of these edge cases that I unfortunatelly
// had to prepare this tool for.
